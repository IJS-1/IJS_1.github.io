<h3>Fiction Book Recommendations</h3>
<li>Uglies by Scott Westerfeld (series)
The Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld is a very engaging and interesting series. The story takes place in the future, and the premise is this: Tally Youngblood is almost 16. She can't wait to get the operation and turn "pretty". Her friend Shay, though, is unsure about the operation. Shay runs away to the Smoke, a place outside the city where "uglies" go when they don't want to have the "pretty" operation. Tally is sent after Shay as a mole,and is told that she will never turn pretty unless she betrays Shay. During her time in the Smoke, Tally discovers a terrible secret about the "pretty" operation, which changes her perception of the world. Eventually she agrees to be a guinea pig for a cure to the "pretty" operation.

<h5> The Prince Warriors by Priscilla Shirer(series)</h5>
<p> The Prince Warriors by Priscilla Shirer is about 4 kids who go on adventures in a land called Ahoratos. Ahoratos is where real battles take place, and the world we live in is only a reflection of it. Ahoratos is where the real battles rage, and the group of kids has many exciting, and even frightening adventures. It is interesting and teaches good lessons about the Bible also.

<h5>Slacker by Gordon Korman(series)</h5>
<p> Slacker by Gordon Korman is about Cameron Boxer, a gamer who wants to slack off and avoid schoolwork all the time. When he almost burns down the house, his parents tell him that he has to get more involved in school or they won't let him game. He creates a club so he can continue gaming, but never expects to actually have to be active in it. It is a very funny and interesting book.
